                <p>Preview: The two time defending champions will look to start the season off with a positive note as they take on the Disney Pixar Baddies. The Baddies want to make a statement opening weekend and show they’re not to be fooled around with.

                <h3>TNF (Prime Video) - Disney Pixar Baddies (1-2) vs Olave Garden (1-2)</h3>
                <h4>Line: DPB -9.1</h4>

                <p>Preview: Two former state champs play in this must win game that may decide their season’s trajectory. These two teams have not been able to get that Enloe Tennis winning culture as they struggle for wins. For the Baddies, this game is their most important as bye week trouble looms ahead. OG needs this win for much needed momentum as they’ll continue to get their star players back from injury.
